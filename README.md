<h1>Wikipedia Viewer</h1>
<p>This project is my solution for Free Code Camp's Intermediate Front End Development Project called Build a Wikipedia Viewer. The goal of the exercise is to be able to search Wikipedia entries then list the results and to get a randomly selected entry with pressing a button. I used <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery</b> to complete it.</p>
